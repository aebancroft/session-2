    <h1>Semantic Elements</h1>
    <h2>&lt;div&gt; tags</h2>
    <p>
      For most of its history, HTML had one element that could act as a generic
      container, the &lt;div&gt; tag. The &lt;div&gt; tag stands for "division",
      and it has very few special styles or attributes of its own. Instead,
      by applying style rules, divs could be used to build up virtually any
      sort of layout imaginable. We'll talk more about page layout in the next
      class session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, a &lt;div&gt; tag by itself doesn't contain much
      information about its <em>meaning</em> in the document. Is this
      crucial content, or just decoration?
    </p>
    <p>
      When the only things distinguishing different kinds of div tags are visual
      rules defined in CSS, users who are visually impaired, who browse with CSS
      disabled, or who access the page through some program besides a standard
      web browser (news reader, assistive software, etc) will have a hard time
      understanding what is going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest version of HTML, <strong>HTML5</strong>, introduced new tags
      to help solve this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not to say that &lt;div&gt; tags are bad, only that there may be
      situations where a more meaningful element is a better alternative.

      <dt>&lt;header&gt;</dt>
      <dd>Header Elements: these denote a header element (banners, etc)</dd>

      <dt>&lt;footer&gt;</dt>
      <dd>
        Footer elements indicate content that is not crucially important
        (copyright info, contact links, etc)
      </dd>

      <dt>&lt;nav&gt;</dt>
      <dd>Nav Elements: these denote navigational tools for the site.</dd>

      <dt>&lt;article&gt;</dt>
      <dd>
        Article Elements: these denote the main text content of a page.
        Some browsers like Safari will grab any article tags to display in a special
        "reading" mode if the user selects that option.
        Articles can be broken up further into &lt;section&gt; tags.
      </dd>

      <dt>&lt;aside&gt;</dt>
      <dd>
        Aside elements indicate things like sidebars, call-outs, or certain
        kinds of navigation that are subordinate to the main content of a page.
