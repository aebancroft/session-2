    <p>
      Using the tags you learned about this week, construct a semantic recipe page
      from the text in the <code>recipe-text.txt</code> file in this folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can place your recipe inside of this <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag so you
      don't have to re-create the entire page from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider using an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element and an unordered list
      for the ingredients, an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag for the main recipe
      with an ordered list of steps inside it, and don't forget to include an image!
